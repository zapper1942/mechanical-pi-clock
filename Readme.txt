They're divided into 1, 2 and 3 Star missions. When you naturally get 1, 2 and 3 Star missions, 
you can access those particular DLC missions. So, basically right near the beginning, as soon as you can 
access mission choices, you can do the 1 Star DLC mission. Around August the 2 Star ones, and in the post 
game the 3 Star ones.
